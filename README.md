- [HatchingTriageSandbox_CloudAPI-lab.ipynb](https://github.com/Tatsuya-hasegawa/TriageSandbox_utils/blob/main/HatchingTriageSandbox_CloudAPI-lab.ipynb)
- - Jupyter Notebook for practicing CloudAPI usage (Python3)

- [make_process_composite_process_tree_output_from_json_report](https://github.com/Tatsuya-hasegawa/TriageSandbox_utils/tree/main/make_process_composite_process_tree_output_from_json_report)
- - Python3 script for making composite process tree with malware family, process file hashes and C2 network about behavioural analysis json reports.
